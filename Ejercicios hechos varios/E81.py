""" Exercise 81: Compute the Hypotenuse
(23 Lines) Write a function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean theorem, as the functionâ€™s result. Include a main program that reads the lengths of the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, uses your function to compute the
length of the hypotenuse, and displays the result. """
